Finding and storing a list of proxies can be taxing. Simply import `proxlist` and have it give you a rotating random proxy to run your requests through.

The list of currently configured proxies have `SSL` support, were tested to be able to accept connections, and were able to serve requests within 10 seconds. This may change over time as proxies change and the list gets updated. These proxies come from all over the world and may not be performant, this package is intended for testing purposes and I make no guarantee about where the data sent through these proxies goes - this package should not (yet) be considered for production applications.

## Install

```bash
# Install tool
pip3 install proxlist

# Install locally
make install
```

## Usage

```python
import proxlist
import requests

proxy = proxlist.random_proxy()

# Alternatively, you could get the entire list of configured proxies
# proxies = proxlist.list_proxies()

proxies = {
    'http': f'http://{proxy}',
    'https': f'http://{proxy}',
}

response = requests.get('https://google.com', proxies=proxies)
print(response.text)
```

## Development

```bash
# Get a comprehensive list of development tools
make help
```
